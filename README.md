# UbiquitousLeaderTrailerHelicesInRibosomalRNAs
This directory contains the custom scripts used for the data analysis in the manuscript "Identification of leader-trailer helices of precursor ribosomal RNA in all phyla of Bacteria and Archaea" by Bryan T. Gemler, Benjamin R. Warner, Ralf Bundschuh, and Kurt Fredrick.

There are 3 subdirectories contained in this repository. Each directory contains a README further describing its contents.
- Covariation-method, which contains code for the the covariation method described in the manuscript
- Shuffling-method, which contains code for the shuffling method described in the manuscript
- Adjusted-ViennaRNA-plotting, which contains the adjusted ViennaRNA plotting code file described in the manuscript.
